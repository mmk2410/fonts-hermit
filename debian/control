Description: Hermit is a monospace font designed to be clear, pragmatic and very readable.
 The creation of Hermit has been focused on programming. Every glyph was
 carefully planned and calculated, according to defined principles and rules.
 For this reason, Hermit is coherent and regular.
 .
 Symbols stand out from common text. Dots and commas are easily seen, and
 operators are clear even when not surrounded by spaces. Similar characters
 have been designed to be very distinguishable from each other.
 .
 It comes in regular, bold and light variants, including italic for every weigt.
 The coverage is a big part of the Latin character set and it includes Powerline
 symbols.
